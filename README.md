# Cheese Popcorn ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/cheese_popcorn-v1.0.0-orange)

This project is a single-page web application - that allows a user to enter criteria into search input in the navbar and display matching titles on the page. For each fetched data, show the title, the poster, and year it released.

Clicking on a title should bring up a detailed view of the title - plot, cast, etc.
